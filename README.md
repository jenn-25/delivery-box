# Jelyn, Rizza & Nessa IoT-Based Secure Delivery Box powered by Arduino
Capstone project completion for ITS 402. A box to store the parcel delivered by riders is create with arduino and solenoid locks. ESP 32 is planned to be used for intermidiating the communication between the device and the backend. The owner can Unlock their box at home using a password that was saved on their account for their corresponding device, an RFID tag or even with a push of a button in their app. The rider then assigned to deliver their parcel can unlock the box to place their deliveries thru a QR code scanner built into the app itself.

After several research and deliverance, we have decided to use react native to build the android app instead of flutter or Native Android (Kotlin/Java) just because of the learning curve since we don't have enough time to repolish our java skills and we don't know how to use flutter yet. We've been working on React more frequently these past months so We thought it is better to use React Native instead due to the limited time left to develop the app.
